            <p class="p1">I have such a strong passion for creating, building and improving tools that help others get work done faster and more efficiently. My curiousity has led me to playing around with some coding but this never seemed like enough. That is when I decided to enroll in Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and increase my knowledge. The skills I hope to acquire from this bootcamp will give me an opportunity to start a new career as a developer. </p>
            <p class="p2">I hope that this bootcamp will give not just my skills a big boost but also give me some great insight on building my portfolio and what employers are looking for in a developer.  </p>
            <p class="p3">I want to acquire a solid understanding of how websites are developed and maintained. I want to build my own portfolio of projects that I am proud to show others. I want to learn how to tackle whiteboard interview questions. I want to build my resume. I want to set myself up for success!</p>
